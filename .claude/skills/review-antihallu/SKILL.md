# Anti-hallucination review

An agent produces plausible code. Plausible ≠ correct. This review hunts for the gap.

Verification procedure (do it, don't skim):
1. Run the test suite yourself. A summary claiming "tests pass" is a claim, not a fact.
2. For every import, function call, API and config key in the diff: open the target and verify it exists — exact name, exact signature, exact location. Invented references are the #1 agent failure.
3. Diff vs plan, task by task: every plan task present? anything in the diff the plan never asked for? Drift in either direction is a finding.
4. Read the tests like production code. Flag tests whose only contract is a CSS
   class, DOM structure, ordinary static label, prop echo or component
   inventory: they increase cost without protecting behavior. Then PROVE the
   valuable tests bite. Pick the one or two invariants the story turns on (a
   guard, predicate, state transition or query clause) and neutralize them:
   invert the condition, return the opposite constant, drop the clause. Run
   the suite, COUNT the red tests, then restore and prove the tree is clean
   (`git diff --exit-code` on the file) before writing a line of report. Report
   what you neutralized and how many tests went red. Zero red on a neutralized
   invariant means it is untested, whatever the suite's total says — that is a
   finding, not a detail. Presentation-only changes need browser evidence, not
   a forced mutation. An assertion-free test is a hallucinated safety net; an
   unrestored mutation is a worse defect than the one you were hunting.
5. Hunt plausible-but-wrong logic: values that look right (defaults, formats, status codes, edge conditions) but were never checked against reality.
6. Regressions: what else uses the touched code paths? Open it.

Five failure modes measured on this codebase, each of which produced a green
suite over a real defect. Hunt them by name:

- **A mutation posted anywhere but at the defect's own site proves nothing.**
  Twice a report claimed "1 red" for a guard neutralised inside the module while
  the bug lived at the composition point — neutralised there, 1320 tests stayed
  green. When you audit a mutation table, check **where** each mutation was
  posted, not just that it went red.
- **A guard that only bites in one module configuration.** Optional modules mean
  every configuration is a shippable product. Run the toggled configuration too;
  three reviews found guards that only bite in the state CI wasn't playing.
- **A complacent test double.** The double itself refused what the test believed
  it was measuring. Prove the double doesn't validate in the server's place:
  neutralise the *server-side* rule and check the forged input becomes accepted.
- **An assertion on a page that hasn't hydrated.** `toHaveCount(0)` before any
  client render passes whatever happens. Require a positive signal (an enabled
  control) before asserting an absence.
- **A measured-sounding claim nobody can check.** "Purge is measured", "the
  compiler holds this wiring", "six occurrences, all cited" — each was false.
  For every count or guarantee written in a comment, an `AGENTS.md` or an ADR,
  ask which command fails when it stops being true. Derive counts rather than
  writing them.

Anything with a screen gets **browser evidence under the production build**.
Seven defects on this codebase were invisible to every command and visible on
sight: a QR code rendered white-on-black, a replaced avatar that kept showing the
old image, a label truncated to one character at 390 px.

Severity scale:
- **critical** — ships a bug, a security hole, an invented API, or breaks existing behavior. Blocks the ship.
- **major** — real defect or rule violation, but scoped and not silently corrupting anything. Ship allowed, fix next cycle.
- **minor** — style, naming, small cleanups.

A fresh context spots these gaps better than the agent that wrote the code. That's why this review runs in an isolated subagent.
